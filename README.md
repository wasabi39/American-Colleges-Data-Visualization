# DATA VISUALIZATION PROJECT

This project is an interactive data visualization of American colleges, written in JavaScript and HTML using Vega Lite. The data was pulled from two datasets on kaggle.com.

One of the main features of the project is the ability to filter colleges on the map by selecting data in any of the graphs.

The project is hosted at https://wasabi39.github.io/American-Colleges-Data-Visualization/
